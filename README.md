# GitHub Actions Auto Check-in

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow for bilibili daily tasks
and the V2EX daily mission reward.

## Usage

1. Push these files to a GitHub repository.
2. Open `Settings` -> `Secrets and variables` -> `Actions`.
3. Add these Repository secrets:
   - `BILIBILI_COOKIE`: the full Cookie header from a logged-in bilibili request.
   - `V2EX_COOKIE`: the full Cookie header from a logged-in V2EX request.
   - `TG_BOT_TOKEN`: the token from BotFather.
   - `TG_CHANNEL_ID`: the channel ID or `@channel_username` that receives the
     Telegram message.
   - `TG_CHAT_ID`: optional fallback chat ID if `TG_CHANNEL_ID` is not set.
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, and `TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID` are
     also supported as aliases.
4. Open `Actions` -> `Auto Check-in` to run it manually, or wait for the schedule.

The default schedule runs at 01:15 UTC every day, which is 09:15 in Beijing
time. Edit the cron expression in `.github/workflows/auto-checkin.yml` if you
want a different time.

## Notes

- Cookies are login credentials. Store them only in GitHub Secrets.
- The script does not bypass captcha, two-factor checks, or anti-abuse systems.
- If either website changes its API or page structure, the script may need an
  update.
- To send to a Telegram channel, add the bot to that channel as an admin with
  permission to post messages. `TG_BOT_TOKEN` + `TG_CHANNEL_ID` is enough.
- Bilibili runs login verification, video watch heartbeat, video sharing,
  one-coin voting, live sign-in, and manga sign-in. The one-coin task consumes
  one coin when a suitable uncoined video is found.
- If bilibili returns that an older live sign-in endpoint is offline, the
  workflow treats that response as a skipped success so V2EX and Telegram
  notifications can still complete.
- V2EX checks the daily mission page, redeems the daily reward when available,
  then reads `/balance` to report the reward amount, current total balance, and
  latest balance record.
- Telegram notifications are sent separately for each service, so Bilibili and
  V2EX have independent message titles and details.

## Script layout

- `scripts/checkin.py`: GitHub Actions entrypoint.
- `scripts/bilibili.py`: Bilibili login, watch, share, coin, live sign-in, and
  manga sign-in tasks.
- `scripts/v2ex.py`: V2EX daily mission and balance parsing.
- `scripts/notify.py`: Telegram notification sending.
- `scripts/common.py`: shared result model and HTTP defaults.
